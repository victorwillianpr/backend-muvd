# Muvd 🍿 Fullstack Project - Backend 🚀

Muvd is a fullstack project that combines web development and movies. As the creator of this project, I've crafted every step, from the backend to the frontend, to deliver a movie information viewing experience that simulates streaming websites.
For the backend of Muvd, we've harnessed the power of Node.js and Express to create a robust server that feeds our application. This server allows seamless connections to TheMovieDatabase API, granting us access to an extensive collection of movie information. This includes details, synopses, ratings, and much more.

## Getting Started
To run the Muvd backend, you'll need to follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory. Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   
2. **Start the Server**:
  Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server by running:
    ```bash
    node server.js
This will initiate the Muvd backend, and you're all set to interact with the fullstack project.

Explore the frontend part of the project in the corresponding repository for a Muvd experience.
